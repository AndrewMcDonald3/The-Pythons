# The Pythons
# D and S Distributor Data Entry/Tracking Application

## About the Application
For many small businesses, it is extremely important to track orders and deliveries. Our Application makes this easy. Tracking deliveries has never been easier!
You can add details about what you recieve and what you deliver and it interfaces directly with a SQLite Database. You can view your latest record or all records in the database.


### Built With

SQLite
Python v3
Using Thonny IDE

## Getting Started

To get started with our application,

* Download the Zip Folder from our Branch "Python Complete"
* Once the file is downloaded, extract it to the file location you wish to keep the application in. NOTE: All Files should be in the same directory
* There will be a .db file called "UserInfo". Make sure this is in the same directory or there will be complications.
* Run the file named "PythonApplication" through Thonny or a Python IDE that supports it.

## Usage

To use this program you will need to log in with a Username and Password. These are declared locally in the code. 
If you do not have a Username or Password, we as a team have built in a Guest Account. This account has a Username of "Guest" and no password.
After you enter a correct Password and Username, click submit and you will be taken to the second screen of the application.
You will be asked about making deliveries on that day. If you have deliveries to make you will click Yes, if your are just viewing records, click No.
Upon clicking Yes, you will prompted with Five Entry Fields. Populate the fields with the correct data and click "Add Data". This will add the record to the database.
Clicking Next after entering data will take you to the review page where you can retrieve all data records or latest records.
Upon clicking No, you will be taken dircetly to a review page where you can retrieve all data records or retrieve the latest record.
In a working enviroment, the database would be locked to prevent unathorized changes to data such as deleting a record/committing fraud.
